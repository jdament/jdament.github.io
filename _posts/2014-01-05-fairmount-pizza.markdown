<p>
	Fairmount pizza, <strong>located at 20th and Fairmount,</strong> was a satisfying experience. We ordered one large plain <i>well-done</i> pizza and walked to pick it up in surprisingly frosty 36 degree weather. Upon arriving, the staff was friendly and the pizza was hot and ready (everyone hates cold and unready pizza).

	We trekked back home in slushy conditions eager to begin our inaugural pizza consumption; the first of hopefully several thousand pies.
