  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	Fairmount pizza, &lt;strong&gt;located at 20th and Fairmount,&lt;/strong&gt; was a satisfying experience. We ordered one large plain &lt;i&gt;well-done&lt;/i&gt; pizza and walked to pick it up in surprisingly frosty 36 degree weather. Our pizza was ready upon arrival and it was still quite hot. Our interaction with the staff was limited and swift... we were out the door within a couple minutes (and managed to catch part of the Packers/49ers game). We'll go ahead and give the in-store experience a 10 out of 10. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We trekked back home in slushy conditions eager to begin our inaugural pizza consumption; the first of hopefully several thousand pies. The unveiling of the pizza was anti-climactic, but we did get a blast of hot, steamy pizza aroma directly into our nostrils. The cheese was well-done, as we had indicated. It should be mentioned that the crust was not burned as a result of ordering the pizza well-done. Three of us polished off 8 slices in roughly 10 minutes. Our thoughts are below:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tyler: Crust 8/10 , Crunch: 7/10 , Cheese: 9/10, Flavor: 7/10, Size: 10/10 
	Tyler's Average score: 41/50 &lt;strong&gt;82%&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
